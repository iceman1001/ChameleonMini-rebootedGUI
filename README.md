### About the clice once technology
The application is being deployed with Click-Once technology, this means that the application phones home to see if there is an update available everytime you start it. If there is an update you get an choice to install or skip.  I do recommend that you update. If you think this is not good for your privacy,  feel free to block the application from reaching internet.  It should work but its untested.
